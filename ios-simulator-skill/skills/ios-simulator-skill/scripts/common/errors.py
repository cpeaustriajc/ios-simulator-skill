"""
Structured error envelopes for agent-friendly failure handling.

Why: agent-driven scripts fail in predictable ways (no booted sim, element
not found, app not installed). Today each script prints a free-form message
and exits 1. Agents have to parse English to decide whether to retry, fix
something, or give up.

This module defines a small, stable envelope:

    {"ok": false, "error": {"code": "...", "message": "...",
                            "hint": "...", "recovery_cmd": "..."}}

`code` is a stable enum agents can branch on. `message` is the human-readable
detail. `hint` describes the likely cause. `recovery_cmd` (optional) is a
single shell command that, if run, would resolve the failure — the agent
can decide whether to execute it.

Success envelopes mirror the structure: `{"ok": true, "data": {...}}`.

Scripts should:
1. Wrap their main() body in `try: ... except SkillError as e: emit_error(e, json_mode=args.json)`.
2. Raise SkillError(code, message, hint=..., recovery_cmd=...) at known failure points.
3. Use the documented codes below; add new ones to the ERROR_CODES list when you introduce them.

Adoption is incremental — existing scripts can migrate one at a time without
breaking anything.
